Make a small React application that:
<ul>
    <li>makes http calls to a public api (for example: https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/search.json?q=cat&restrict_sr=1)</li>
    <li>have some text inputs for users to customize the call to the api, with very basic input validation</li>
    <li>display the results from the api in a list view</li>
    <li>click on a result to see a details view with more information</li>
    <li>basic styling, maybe some animation</li>
</ul>
Give yourself a few hours to complete this challenge. If you get stuck, leave a comment about how you figured out the problem, or how you intend to figure it out if you had more time. Submitting something that documents your attempt and intent is better than submitting something perfect that takes multiple days to complete.

Try to cover any edge cases or potential performance problems if you come across them. Creativity is encouraged but simplicity is better!

quick recommendations:

    use create-react-app and publish the finished code to github
    use netlify to host your application

If you can send us the repo link and the netlify link when you're done that would be ideal.
